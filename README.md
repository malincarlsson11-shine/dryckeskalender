# Drink Calendar – 12 weeks

A free, anonymous, and privacy-friendly web-based drink calendar for personal reflection on alcohol consumption.

The service is intended to give users an overview of their consumption over time and can be used as a basis for reflection and in dialogue with, for example, therapists.  
It does not replace care, treatment, or medical assessment.

##  Privacy & anonymity

Privacy is a fundamental principle of this project.

- All data is stored **only locally in the user's browser**
- No data is sent to any server
- No login, no accounts, no personal data
- No third-party analysis or tracking
- The operator has no access to user data

### Same device
The calendar is linked to the device and browser where it was created.  
If browser data is cleared or the device is replaced, the calendar cannot be restored.

### Automatic deletion
For increased privacy, the calendar is deleted if no new entries have been made in 5 days.  
The deletion occurs when the user opens the calendar again.
